# Auto-dialogue  
This repository aims to play dialogue between a system agent and a user simulator automatically.  
For this repository, you need to a pretrained model of transformers (a library for BERT-like models by pytorch).  

## Usage  
1. add some directories to `PYTHONPATH`  
``` 
export PYTHONPATH="<YOUR PATH>/components:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="<YOUR PATH>/utils:$PYTHONPATH"
```

2. prepare pretrained models

3. write some settings to setting.yml  

4. implement `python main.py`
